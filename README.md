## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Basic Sass
- Full Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned how to make the menu responsive, with pure html css and js.
I discovered the clip-path property to build shapes


### Continued development

I plan to do the project by laying out the page with grids. I think I should improve how to make better navbars, since I usually only do them with bootstrap
